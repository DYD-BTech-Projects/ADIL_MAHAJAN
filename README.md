## 🎯 How to Use This Marvel

### 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Wait for the Epic Loading Screen** (trust me, it's worth it)
2. **Add Your Processes** using the control panel:
   - Enter **Arrival Time** (when the process shows up)
   - Enter **Burst Time** (how long it needs the CPU)
   - Smash that **"Add Process"** button! 💥

3. **Run the Simulation** and watch the magic unfold:
   - Processes move from Ready → Running → Completed
   - Gantt chart builds in real-time
   - Metrics calculate automatically

4. **View Results** - See average waiting time, turnaround time, and more!

### 🖥️ Terminal Mode
Click **"View C Program in Terminal"** to see the C implementation run with your data - complete with ANSI colors and formatted output that'll make you feel like a 1980s hacker!

## 🌈 Color Palette (Because We're Fancy)

The simulation uses a carefully curated color scheme:
- 🟢 **Green** - Completed processes
- 🔵 **Blue** - Ready queue
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Metrics
- 🟣 **Purple** - Headers and accents
- ⚪ **Gray** - Idle CPU time

---

## 🔧 Customization Ideas

Want to make it even MORE awesome? Try:

- 🎨 **Change Colors** - Edit the `ganttColors` array
- ⚡ **Adjust Speed** - Modify the `setInterval` delay (currently 1000ms)
- 🎭 **Add Sound Effects** - Make it go BEEP BOOP!
- 🌍 **Add More Algorithms** - SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling
- 📱 **Mobile Gestures** - Swipe to add processes!

---

## 🐛 Known Features (Not Bugs!)

- Terminal can't actually open native shell (browsers won't let us, security and stuff)
- Loading screen takes 3.5 seconds (it's artistic timing!)
- Processes must have positive burst times (makes sense, right?)
- Maximum coolness factor achieved ✅
